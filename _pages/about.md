I am an Assistant Professor of [Southern University of Science and Technology](http://www.sustech.edu.cn) (南方科技大学, SUSTech for short) in the [math department](https://math.sustech.edu.cn) at Shenzhen China.

Before that , I was a postdoc at [ETH Zurich](https://math.ethz.ch) in the group of [Rahul Pandharipand](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~rahul/) and [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de) at Bonn. I got my PhD from Beijing International Center For Mathematical Research, Peking University, under the supervision of [Xiaobo Liu](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~xbliu/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of algebraic geometry and mathematical physics, with a particular focus on Gromov-Witten theory. My Erdős number is 5.

Starting from the Fall of 2022, I am co-organizing the [Lambda Seminar](https://lambda.sustech.edu.cn) with the aim to enhance the communication between mathematicians working in the area of Geometry and Mathematical Physics.
