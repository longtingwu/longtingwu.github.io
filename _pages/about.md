I am currently visiting the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de) at Bonn.

Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [ETH Zurich](https://math.ethz.ch) in the group of [Rahul Pandharipand](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~rahul/). I got my PhD in 2017 from Beijing International Center For Mathematical Research, Peking University, under the supervision of [Xiaobo Liu](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~xbliu/). 

My research interests lie in algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. In particular, my research focuses on the study of Gromov-Witten theory.
