I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich in the group of [Rahul Pandharipand](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~rahul/). Before that, I got my PhD from Beijing International Center For Mathematical Research, Peking University, under the supervision of [Xiaobo Liu](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~xbliu/). I will move to Max Planck Institute for Mathematics at Bonn this autumn.
